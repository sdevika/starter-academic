Devika Subramanian is a professor of computer science at Rice University. The main theme that drives her
research is bringing big data and machine learning/artificial intelligence to bear on large scale
problems in science, engineering, medicine and public policy. She has spent the last 25 years developing
novel prediction algorithms and modeling techniques for a range of decision-making problems in medicine,
engineering, natural sciences, and social sciences with support from the NSF, ONR, NIH, DHS, DARPA, and the
City of Houston. Her recent projects are in the areas of medical decision making, forecasting weather and
disease, analysis of social media data to understand public support for issues, detecting and analyzing the
influence of bots on social media, neuroscience of human learning, and assessments of hurricane wind and
rainfall flooding risks.
